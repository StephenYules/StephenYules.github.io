                <h1 style= "margin-left:175px";> History of the SSSS</h1>
                <hr style= "width:1180px">
                        <div class="new">
                            <p> The SSSS all started in the year of 2018 when the new first class of the new <strong>Enterprise IGCSE</strong> subject was given the task of running the snack shop for the whole year. None knew they were going to do this but were excited of the future and they started to run teh business inherited by the old snack lady. </p>

                            <p>Throughout the year, the students went through multiple problems and walls getting in there way, but they always got past them. They had some bumps including having one of the glass doors on the cabinet break, having to clean the whole shop for the fear of being closed, and dealing with their own <i>useless</i> workers.</p>

                            <p>As they learned new skills in the enterprise class, they implemented them into the shop, further improving it month after month. Some chapters include <strong>finance, skills and business structures.</strong> Then at the end of the year, they split their profits and said goodbye to their business. The year went as so:</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Start of learning how to run the snack shop.</li>
                                <li>First couple months with good managers but lots of problems.</li>
                                <li>Start of the downward spiral they were going into.</li>
                                <li>December Break - Enthusiam in the workers lowers and tensions rise.</li>
                                <li>Further plummeting due to bad managers and everyone being tired.</li>
                                <li>Summer break comes and they are done with the hell that was running the business.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>Throughout the year, there were some people with valuable roles to the enteprrise and here is a list of them and their roles : </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Em Chu for being a great manager, helping with accounting and was there to fix any problem.</li>
                                <li>Stephen Yules for paying their supplier each morning and working the most shift out of everyone throghout the year while helping solve all their financial problems.</li>
                                <li>Nathan Juravaramit for ordering popcorn every week and coming to shift on time.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>There were also certain properties of peopel taht casued more work overall for others and created problems in the enterprise which included:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Not coming to work on time</li>
                                <li>Not bothering to come at all</li>
                                <li>Being a bad manager/not doing their job</li>
                                <li>Creating internal problems or discourse with other workers</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Even with all these problems, the first year still managed to have a fairly successful year with money given to everyone.</p>
